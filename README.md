Hi! Here my test work. I have used parcell. Breakpoint 1280 px for desktop. Lower - for mobile.
Mobile design I tried do it maximum approximately to page. For rendering collections, I used JS. So,
if you check my work in browser on adaptive - please, refresh page and yow will get new markup, that
should be adaptived for opted dimension. For insert images, I used img without choosing pictures of
different resolutions, I only optimized images using squosh. But if it is crtitical I will add
images using source element. Thanks for your attention. Looking forward for review.
